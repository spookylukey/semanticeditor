WYMeditor extensions
====================

The semantic editor application provides its own version of WYMeditor.  This
is derived from the skins/templates found in django-cms2, with the following
customisations:


 - name of the skin changed from 'django' to 'semanticeditor'.  This is
   necessary if we are to allow two different versions of WYMeditor on the
   same page, one using the normal WYMeditor + CMS controls, another with
   the full 'semantic editor' controls, for longer pieces of content.

 - The skin.js file removes the 'classes' panel, since it is replaced by
   dynamic elements.

 - skins.css - added styling for additional presentation controls

 - a WYMeditor plugin named 'semantic' has been added.  This implements
   most of the client side logic for this application.

 - the editorwidget.html template has been changed.  In particular
   - the skin has been changed to 'semanticeditor'
   - a call to wymeditor.semantic() has been added to set up the plugin.

 - a new django widget 'SemanticEditor' has been created that inherits from
   the django 'WYMEditor' widget in django-cms2.  This is needed so that
    - the WYMeditor plugin javascript file can be added to Media
    - our editorwdiget.html template can be used.
